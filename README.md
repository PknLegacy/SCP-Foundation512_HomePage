# SCP Foundation 512 - Homepage Archive

Welcome to the official **Foundation 512 Web Archive**.  
This repository contains the source code, assets, and structure of the SCP-Foundation512 Homepage.  
It is designed to simulate a **classified SCP Foundation archive portal** in a realistic style, with interactive systems and expandable content.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description

This project recreates a **Foundation-like online archive** that allows users to:
- Enter the **Home Portal** with introduction and visuals.  
- Browse the **Files Section** (SCP List with placeholders for 50 SCPs).  
- Use the **Search Section** to find and access files (MP3, MP4, TXT placeholders).  
- Read the **Credits Section** (with additional details and resources).  
- Experience immersive **background sounds**, terminal-like **keyboard effects**, and archive-style navigation.

All SCP entries, texts, and media files are currently placeholders.  
You can replace them with your own SCP documents, videos, and audio recordings.
